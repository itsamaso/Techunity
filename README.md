In today’s digital world, communities thrive where connection and learning come
together.

**Techunity** was born from this vision: a platform where technology
enthusiasts, developers, and learners can not only interact socially but also grow
their technical skills in meaningful ways. Built with modern web technologies — **React 18, TypeScript, and Appwrite’s**
Backend-as-a-Service. The platform unites the strengths of a social media network with an educational coding hub.
